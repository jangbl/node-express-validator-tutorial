# How to run this application

## Running the project

Make sure to install the dependencies with `npm`

```
npm install
```

You can then run the project by executing

```
npm run dev
```

which will start up a development server on port `8080`.

## API

### POST /register

Expected payload

```
{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "your-password"
}
```

The server will return a `400` bad request error if the request body does not conform to the expected schema (valid email and a password with at least `5` characters).

Please also check out the `./schema` directory to learn more about the expected request body.
